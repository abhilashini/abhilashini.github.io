    Rewriting code on impulse risks breaking what users rely on. 
    Even flawed systems have hidden purpose. Refactor only 
    after tests safeguard needs and plans ensure continuity.

    Clarity on requirements builds reusability, not just deliverables. 
    Prioritize “plug and play” systems over “patch and pray” fixes.

    If a code block doesn’t trace to a user flow or data-driven need, 
    it’s noise. Codebases thrive when they reflect **why** they exist,
    not just **how** they work. Good products are anchored in code 
    charted by users purpose and needs.

  text: >-
    Frameworks and algorithms solve narrow problems. When they warp a 
    product’s design, users inherit their quirks. Bend tools to user 
    needs, never the reverse.

    def format_name(user_input, user_locale):  
      # Let users define their own rules, not frameworks  
      if user_locale == "jp":  
          return f"{user_input.last_name} {user_input.first_name}"  
      else:  
          return f"{user_input.first_name} {user_input.last_name}"

    When errors leave developers guessing, users suffer too. 
    Maintainability begins with empathy — for our future selves, users 
    and inheriting developers. Self-diagnosing logs, actionable alerts, 
    and structured errors turn debugging from scavenger hunts into guided fixes.
