    Rewriting code on impulse risks breaking what users rely on. 
    Even flawed systems have hidden purpose. Refactor only 
    after tests safeguard needs and plans ensure continuity.

    Clarity on requirements builds reusability, not just deliverables. 
    Prioritize “plug and play” systems over “patch and pray” fixes.

    If a code change doesn’t trace to a user flow or data-driven need, 
    it’s noise. Codebases thrive when they document **why** they exist,
    not just **how** they work. Code should be a map, not a maze.

    Frameworks and algorithms solve narrow problems. When they warp a 
    product’s design, users inherit their quirks. Bend tools to user 
    needs, never the reverse.

    If a system’s errors confuses developers, they’ll confuse users too. 
    Maintainability begins with empathy — for our future selves, users 
    and inheriting developers. Include self-diagnosing loggers, 
    actionable alerts, structured errors and tests to turn debugging 
    from scavenger hunts into guided fixes.
